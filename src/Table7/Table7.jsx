        <h2>How to start using IoT sensors for real estate and facility management</h2>
        <p>
        The integration of IoT sensors into corporate real estate (CRE) and facility management (FM) offers numerous benefits for enhancing workplace efficiency and productivity. Real-time data collected from these sensors provides valuable insights into building occupancy, temperature, indoor air quality, and energy consumption. This information empowers CRE and FM professionals to optimize building performance, improve energy efficiency,
         and create a comfortable environment for occupants.

        <p>
        By leveraging IoT-enabled energy monitoring, organizations can make data-driven decisions, implement targeted energy-saving measures, and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Additionally, IoT sensors enable various workplace applications, including smart room and desk booking, asset and equipment tracking, space planning, and smart cleaning. These applications streamline processes, enhance resource utilization,
         and improve the overall workplace experience.
